  <!-- ABOUT -->
<h1>Thibault Michel – Product Designer</h1>
  </br>
    <p>I’m an experienced UX/UI designer for mobile and web applications. I’m proficient in the entire digital product design process including strategy, concept, execution and delivery in an agile environment.
      I’ve spent the last few years designing small and large scale customer experiences for some of New Zealand’s leading companies, with the products I’ve designed being used by thousands of people every day.
